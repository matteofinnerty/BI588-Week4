**Week 4: Module 8 Notes*

Announcements
- Homework 3 due March 3rd. 
- Choose replication paper by 2/18

**Statistical Inference**
Trying to draw conclusion about a population based on measurements from a noisy sample or trying to evaluate whether it is reasonable to assume that our sample is drawn from a particular population. 

Complications: 
a. our sample may be biased
b. there may be confounding variables
c. 

**Probability**
Summarize the relative frequencies of possible outcomes. 
Applied to the population level by describing the magnitude of chance associated with particular observations. 
Probabilities vary between 0 and 1. 

*We will use the {manipulate} package. To run manipulate effectively you must run the code directly in the console, it does not work in R markdown documents. Once run, the graph will appear in the Plots tab in the bottom right. 

Importing {manipulate}
```{r}
library(manipulate)


```

Rolling a die example
```{r}
#RUN THIS IN THE CONSOLE
outcomes <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
manipulate(hist(sample(outcomes, n, replace = TRUE), breaks = c(0.5, 1.5, 2.5,
    3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5), probability = TRUE, main = paste("Histogram of Outcomes of ",
    n, " Die Rolls", sep = ""), xlab = "roll", ylab = "probability"), n = slider(0,
    10000, initial = 10, step = 10))
```

**Rules of Probability**
*Positive probability*: Probability that something occurs
*Null probability*: Probability that nothing occurs
*Union symbol (U)*: essentially OR
*Intersection symbol (Upside down union)*: essentially AND
*Given symbol*: |
*Mutually exclusive*: cannot co-occur, probability is 0
*Bar above symbol*: means the complement of, essentially NOT
a. example - Pr(A with line above) is the same as Pr(not A)
*Independence*: the instance of one event does not affect the probability of the instance of another event

There are a bunch of equations for probabilities 

**Random Variables**
A variable whose outcomes are assumed to arise by chance or according to some random mechanism.

Two types
*Discrete*: countable
*Continuous*: can be measured to infinite values (ie. they can be any real number within a range). NOT countable. 

**Probability function**
A mathematical function that describes the chance associate with a random variable having a particular outcome or falling within a given range of outcomes. 

2 types:

1.*Probability mass functions (PMF)* are associated with discrete random variables. These functions describe the probability that a random variable takes a particular value.
To be a valid PMF...
  1. there are a set number of possible, distinct outcomes
  2. the probability of any outcome is greater than 0. 
  3. The sum of the probabilities of all outcomes is 1.
  
  *Cumulative Probability Graph*
    Used for Discrete Random Variables.Adds the probabilities of the outcomes. After all possible outcomes are added, the probability          should   be 1. 

2. *Probability density functions* are associated with continuous random variables. These functions describe the probability that a random variable falls within a given range of outcomes. The area under the curve = the probability.
To be a valid PDF...
  1. the probability that the random variable is greater than a certain number is never negative ???
  2. the total area under the curve is 1.

The *Beta Distribution* refers to a family of continuous probability distributions defined over the interval [0, 1] and parametrized by two positive shape parameters, denoted by 𝛼and 𝛽, that appear as exponents of the random variable 𝑥 and control the shape of the distribution. (I don't fully understand what alpha and beta represent)

  The *Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)* of a random variable is defined sa the probability of observing a random variable X taking    the vaue of x or less. 
  
  Like the Cumulative Probability Graph, we see a continuous curve increasing probability until we hit 1. This is essentially the            continuous equivalent of the Cumulative Probability Graph.

**Expected Mean and Variance of Random Variables**


**The Bernoulli Distribution**
The probability of a binary random variable (only 2 possible outcomes).
Probability mass function for bernoulli distribution: 

*The Bernoulli distribution is a special case of the binomial distribution*
The bernoulli dsitribution is just one trial. The binomial distribution is essentially many bernoulli trials. 

dbinom is the density function for the binomial distribution. dbinom(x = k, size = n, prob = p) where k is the number of successes, n is the number of trials, p is the probability of success.


**Poisson distribution**
Used for counts. Lower limit is 0, upper limit is infinity.
